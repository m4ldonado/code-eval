       Challenge Description:

       There are many computer and human viruses nowadays. Scientists are
       scratching their heads over antiviruses that could stop a
       particular virus and, in most cases, they find right solutions.
       So, virologists need to know which antiviruses can protect us from
       viruses, and what they still have to work on to secure against the
       remaining viruses. Letâ€™s help them out!


       Input sample:

       The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test
       case with virus components in the hexadecimal numeral system (HEX)
       and antivirus components in the binary number system (BIN). Virus
       and antivirus components are separated by a pipeline '|'.

       64 6e 78 | 100101100 11110 5e 7d 59 | 1101100 10010101 1100111 93
       75 | 1000111 1011010 1100010


       Output sample:

       Your task is to calculate the sum of all virus components and
       compare it with the sum of antivirus components. If the numbers
       are the same or the sum of antivirus components is greater than
       the sum of virus components, this means that the virus was
       stopped. So, print True. Otherwise, print False.

       True True False


       Constraints:

         1. The sum of components can be from 60 to 1500.

         2. The number of components in virus and antivirus can be from 1
           to 8.

         3. The number of test cases is 40.
