       Challenge Description:

       As we know from our school history course, the ancient
       civilizations needed Ï€ (PI) value for the mathematical
       calculations. In the 5th century, the Chinese mathematicians
       calculated this value to seven decimal digits by using geometrical
       technics. In Indian mathematics, it was calculated to five decimal
       digits. As the computer science developed, the mathematicians
       managed to calculate the decimal representation of PI to over 10
       trillion digits.
       Surely, we do not need the PI value calculated to 10 trillion
       digits, but 5000 digits sound just right. So, we need to define
       the number located at the certain sequence number in PI.

       Input sample:

       The first argument is a path to a file. Each line includes a test
       case, which comprises a number indicating the sequence number of a
       PI value.

       3 1 1654


       Output sample:

       Print the number that is located at that sequence number.

       4 3 1


       Constraints:

         1. The sequence number cannot exceed 5000.

         2. Comma in the PI value is not a sequence number element.

         3. The number of test cases is 30.
